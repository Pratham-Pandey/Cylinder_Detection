# Cylinder_Detection

## What?
The objective of the project is to detect cylinder from a video or a live video stream. This Repository contains the source code file and an output video of the Cylinder Detection Problem.  

## Why?
This model can be intigrated with other Computer Vision based systems to check for Defects, Lekage, damage etc in a gas cylinder

## Who? 
It can be used at Cylinder Reffiling Centers to inspect the cylinder along with refilling.

## How?
The model is trained to detect cylinder by applying **Transfer Learning** on a pre-trained object deection model downloaded **Tensorflow Model Zoo**.
